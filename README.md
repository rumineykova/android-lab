# android-lab
A beginners lab for Android development 
https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/371M/lectures/01-java-review.pdf

# Let's learn about Android! These are must read:
* Refresh your Java skills here [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/371M/lectures/01-java-review.pdf)
* Java very minimal code convention that you should follow, read [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/styleguide.shtml)
* Very useful Android development course from Stanford [here] [visualisation tools](https://try.github.io/)
* Android fundamentals [here] (https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals)


# Let's practice 
Before you start: 
1. Create a github acccount. 
2. check that you have git installed: </br>
3. Open the git bash application (we will be using gitBash to write git command throughout the tutorial) </br>
## :warning:This week's deliverables 
Completing assignments *Part I* and *Part II* is advisory. </br>
If you complete assignments *Part III* you will will become an Android ninja! </br>
Next week we will continue with Android development. Your compulsory submission deadline will be next week. </br>
However the skill this week will be essential if you want to succeed with next week's Android task. </br>

## Part I: Basic Android skills: Create your first Android app    
Let's get started, follow the steps below. </br>
* Step 1: Open Android Studio 
* Step 2: Create a new project with a name Dice Roller (hint: If you struggle, check [here](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project))
* Step 3: Create the user interface: one button with the name click me, and a text box for displaying numbers 
* Step 3.1: Create the user interface. The user screen should look like this:
* Step 3.2: The state of the screen after you change the screen should be: 
* Step 4: Once the user clicks on the button, the text of the text box should show a random number.

## Part II: Fix the bug
In this exercise, you will modify an existing repository and will submit a pull request for it. </br>
Let's get strated, follow the steps below: </br>
* __Step 1:__ Accept the assignment invitation from this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/38k1-dLf) </br>
   Accepting the invitation will create a copy of the repository for you. </br>
   The name of the assignement repository will be something like: git-lab-yourusername  </br>
   In the above yourUserName will be your actual github name </br>
   The link to your repository will be: https://github.com/BrunelCS/git-lab-yourUserName </br>
   Again, note that yours will have the same naming convention but instead of yourUserName, there will be your github username </br>
* __Step 2:__ Fork this repository 
* __Step 3:__ Open the repository in Android studio. 
* __Step 4:__ Compile the project, you will notice that the file does not compile. 
* __Step 5:__ Find the problem and fix it. 
* __Step 6:__ Submit a Pull Request so I can fix the bug to fix the problem. 

## Part III: :feet: Looking for this week's Android ninja!
Now when we know the basics of Android, let's have some fun with it. </br>
Add a finish button on the main Activity screen, clicking the button sends you to a new screen </br>
On the new screen there must be one button called "Share your score on slack" </br>
When you click the button </br>
Hints: </br>
Update gradle with slack-api repository </br>
Update the manifest file to allow user permissions on have network access and wifi </br>
The full API can be founds here, use it for referene to find which buttons you should use!</br>
Generate a slack token </br>

There are prizes (android stickers) for whoever manages to complete it! Good luck!</br>
You will also be listed on the lab page as and Android master of the week! </br>


## Part IV: Finally, it is time to test your git knowledge

  * start a new repository and publish it on git ([hint](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#github))
  * contribute to an existing branch  ([hint](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#github))
